# Requesting Additions or Changes

Have an idea for improving Slack MCP Server? We welcome feature requests and suggestions from our community! This guide will help you submit effective feature requests.

## Before Submitting

Before submitting a feature request, please:

1. **Check existing requests**: Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server/issues) to see if someone has already suggested a similar feature.
2. **Read the documentation**: Make sure the feature doesn't already exist or isn't already planned in our roadmap.
3. **Consider compatibility**: Think about how your suggestion fits with the existing architecture and goals of the project.

## How to Submit a Feature Request

Please submit feature requests through our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server/issues) page using the "Feature Request" template.

### What to Include

An effective feature request should include:

1. **Clear and descriptive title**: Summarize the proposed feature concisely.
2. **Problem statement**: Describe the problem that this feature would solve.
   - What are you trying to accomplish?
   - Why is it difficult or impossible with the current implementation?
   - Who else might benefit from this feature?

3. **Proposed solution**: Describe your idea for implementing the feature.
   - Be as specific as possible
   - Include mockups or diagrams if applicable
   - Consider edge cases and potential issues

4. **Alternative solutions**: Have you considered other ways to solve this problem?

5. **Implementation considerations**: If you have technical insights about how to implement the feature, please share them.

6. **Impact and importance**: Explain why this feature would be valuable to users and the project.

## Example Feature Request

```
Title: Add WebSocket transport option for real-time updates

Problem Statement:
Currently, Slack MCP Server supports HTTP streaming and SSE for client communication. 
However, for truly bidirectional real-time communication, these options have limitations. 
Many modern web applications would benefit from WebSocket support for more efficient 
real-time updates and lower latency.

Proposed Solution:
Add a new transport option "websocket" that implements the WebSocket protocol. This would:
- Allow bidirectional communication between client and server
- Reduce overhead compared to HTTP polling or SSE
- Enable real-time updates for task changes, comments, etc.
- Follow the same MCP message format as existing transports

The implementation should include:
1. New WebSocketTransport class implementing the Transport interface
2. Client-side connection handling and reconnection logic
3. Support for the same authentication mechanisms as existing transports

Alternative Solutions:
1. Enhance the SSE implementation with custom headers for upstream communication
2. Implement long-polling with improved efficiency

Implementation Considerations:
This would require adding a WebSocket library dependency (e.g., websockets for Python).
Care should be taken to ensure proper connection management and resource cleanup.

Impact and Importance:
This feature would greatly improve real-time applications built on Slack MCP Server,
reducing latency and improving the user experience for collaborative tools.
```

## After Submitting

After you've submitted a feature request:

- Be responsive to questions about your proposal
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Consider contributing to the implementation if you have the skills

Thank you for helping improve Slack MCP Server!
