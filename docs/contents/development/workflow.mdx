# Development Workflow

This guide outlines the recommended workflow for contributing to the ClickUp MCP Server project.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start development, make sure you have completed all the steps in the [Requirements](./requirements.mdx) guide.

## Development Process

### 1. Pick or Create an Issue

- Browse existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server/issues) to find something to work on
- If you have a new idea, create a new issue describing the change you want to make
- Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

### 2. Create a Branch

#### Fork the Repository

First, fork the project to your own GitHub account:

1. Go to the [ClickUp MCP Server repository](https://github.com/Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right
3. Wait for GitHub to create your fork
4. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/slack-mcp-server.git
cd slack-mcp-server
```

#### Set Up the Upstream Remote

Add the original repository as an "upstream" remote to keep your fork in sync:

```bash
# Add the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server.git

# Verify your remotes
git remote -v
```

#### Sync with Upstream

Before creating a new branch, sync your fork with the upstream repository:

```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Checkout your fork's master branch
git checkout master

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/master

# Push the changes to your fork
git push origin master
```

#### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch from the updated `master` branch with a descriptive name:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use prefixes like `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`, or `refactor/` to indicate the type of change.

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Coding Style and Rules](./coding-style.mdx)
- Keep your changes focused on the issue you're addressing
- Write tests for your changes
- Update documentation as necessary

### 4. Run Tests Locally

Before submitting your changes, make sure all tests pass:
   
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip" default>
    ```bash
    # Run all tests
    pytest
    
    # Run with coverage report
    pytest --cov=clickup_mcp_server
    
    # Run specific tests
    pytest test/path/to/test_file.py
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry" label="poetry">
    ```bash
    # Run all tests
    poetry run pytest
    
    # Run with coverage report
    poetry run pytest --cov=clickup_mcp_server
    
    # Run specific tests
    poetry run pytest test/path/to/test_file.py
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="uv" label="uv">
    ```bash
    # Run all tests
    uv run pytest
    
    # Run with coverage report
    uv run pytest --cov=clickup_mcp_server
    
    # Run specific tests
    uv run pytest test/path/to/test_file.py
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 5. Run Pre-commit Hooks

Ensure code quality by running pre-commit hooks:
   
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip" default>
    ```bash
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="poetry" label="poetry">
    ```bash
    poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="uv" label="uv">
    ```bash
    uv run pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add websocket transport support"
```

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### 7. Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request

- Go to the GitHub repository and create a new pull request
- Provide a clear description of the changes
- Reference the issue number (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Complete the pull request template

### 9. Code Review

- Address any feedback from reviewers
- Make additional commits as needed
- Push updates to your branch

### 10. Merge

Once your pull request is approved:
- It will be merged into the main branch
- The CI/CD pipeline will run automatically

## Continuous Integration

All pull requests are automatically checked with our [CI/CD pipeline](./ci-cd/index.mdx), which:
- Runs all tests
- Checks code style and quality
- Generates coverage reports
- Builds documentation

## Release Process

New releases are created by the core maintainers following this process:

1. Update version number in relevant files
2. Update the changelog
3. Create a new release branch
4. Create a GitHub release with release notes
5. Publish to PyPI

## Need Help?

If you need assistance at any point in the development process:
- Ask questions in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server/discussions)
- Reach out to the maintainers via the contact information in the README
