# Additional CI Workflows

This document covers the specialized CI workflows that support specific aspects of the ClickUp MCP Server project beyond the main continuous integration and release processes.

## Overview

The project includes several specialized CI workflows that handle specific operational tasks:

- **üîç API Specification Checking** - Automated monitoring of ClickUp API changes
- **üê≥ Docker CI** - Container image building and testing
- **üìã DockerHub README CI** - Repository description synchronization
- **ü§ñ Documentation Auto-Approve & Auto-Merge** - Streamlined docs updates

---

## Docker CI

The `docker-ci.yml` workflow tests Docker image building and functionality.

**Triggers:**
- **Push to master**: When Docker-related files change
  - GitHub Actions workflow files
  - Python source code (`slack_mcp/**/*.py`)
  - Dockerfile and Docker scripts

**Purpose**: Validates Docker image builds and containerized application functionality.

**Key Features:**
- Validates Docker image build process
- Tests containerized application functionality
- Ensures Docker configuration correctness
- Separate from the main release Docker builds

## DockerHub README CI

The `dockerhub-readme-ci.yml` workflow updates the Docker Hub repository description.

**Triggers:**
- **Push to master**: When `README_DOCKERHUB.md` is modified
- **Workflow file changes**: When the DockerHub README workflow itself is updated

**Purpose**: Keeps Docker Hub repository description synchronized with the documentation.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic synchronization of Docker Hub repository description
- Triggered by changes to Docker-specific documentation
- Maintains consistency between repository and registry documentation

---

## Documentation Auto-Approve & Auto-Merge

[![Docs-only auto-approve & automerge](https://github.com/Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server/actions/workflows/docs-automerge.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server/actions/workflows/docs-automerge.yml)

The `docs-automerge.yml` workflow automatically approves and merges pull requests that only contain documentation changes. This streamlines the process for documentation updates.

**Triggers:**
- **Pull requests to master**: For PRs containing only documentation changes
- **PR events**: `opened`, `reopened`, `synchronize`, `ready_for_review`

**Purpose**: Accelerates documentation updates by automating approval and merge for docs-only changes.

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent detection of documentation-only changes
- Automated approval and merge for qualifying PRs
- Safety checks to ensure only documentation files are modified
- Streamlined workflow for maintaining up-to-date documentation

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- Validates that PR contains only documentation file changes
- Requires all status checks to pass before auto-merge
- Maintains audit trail of automated actions

## Workflow Integration

These additional CI workflows integrate with the main CI/CD system:

### **Integration Points:**
- **API Spec Checking** ‚Üí Feeds into development planning and feature updates
- **Docker CI** ‚Üí Validates containers before release workflows 
- **DockerHub README** ‚Üí Ensures registry documentation stays current
- **Docs Auto-merge** ‚Üí Accelerates documentation maintenance

### **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
- All workflows include status badges for easy monitoring
- Failed workflows trigger notifications for immediate attention
- Regular review ensures workflows stay aligned with project needs
