# Web APIs

The Slack MCP Server provides HTTP endpoints for monitoring and interacting with the server. These endpoints follow standard REST conventions and return JSON responses.

The server implements HTTP endpoints that enable:

- **Server Monitoring**: Check server health and status
- **System Integration**: Allow other services to interact with the server
- **Standardized Responses**: Well-structured JSON responses and error handling
