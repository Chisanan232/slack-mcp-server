## Example Bug Report

```
Title: Server crashes when handling concurrent requests with SSE transport

Environment:
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Python: 3.10.4
- Slack MCP Server: 0.2.1
- Installed via pip

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start the server with SSE transport: `slack-mcp-server --transport sse`
2. Create a test script that sends 10 concurrent requests
3. Execute the test script

Expected Behavior:
All requests should be processed correctly, and responses returned to clients.

Actual Behavior:
Server crashes with the following error:
```
[ERROR] 2025-08-10 14:23:47 - Exception in SSE transport: RuntimeError: Cannot process concurrent requests
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/slack_mcp_server/transport/sse.py", line 127, in handle_request
    ...
```

Additional Information:
This only happens with SSE transport. HTTP streaming works fine with concurrent requests.
```
