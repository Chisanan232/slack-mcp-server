# Why I Created This Project

On June 16, 2025, I began development on the Slack MCP Server project. This project was born out of a specific need I encountered while working with Slack and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## The Need for a Stronger MCP Server

The existing MCP server implementations for Slack were not robust enough for my requirements. They lacked some critical features and performance characteristics that I needed for my specific use cases.

## Built on Python

Another key motivation was that the available MCP servers were primarily JavaScript-based. As Python is my preferred programming language, I decided to develop a new MCP server that would leverage Python's strengths:

- Strong typing capabilities
- Extensive ecosystem of libraries
- Excellent performance for server applications
- Familiar syntax and paradigms for me and many other developers

By building on Python, I could create a solution that was not only powerful but also more maintainable for my workflow and accessible to the Python developer community.

## Project Goals

The Slack MCP Server aims to provide:

1. A robust and reliable MCP server specifically designed for Slack
2. Python-native implementation with strong typing
3. Comprehensive documentation
4. High performance and scalability
5. Easy extension and customization

This blog will track the ongoing development and improvements to the Slack MCP Server project.
